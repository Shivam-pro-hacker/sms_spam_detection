# sms_spam_detection
A machine-learning based SMS spam classifier using NLP techniques and a Streamlit web app.
🚨 SMS Spam Detection System (NLP + Machine Learning)

A machine-learning–based SMS Spam Detection system that classifies text messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a pre-trained ML model.
The project includes a web interface built with Streamlit and demonstrates practical use of text preprocessing, vectorization, and model inference.

🔍 Project Overview

This project detects spam messages by analyzing the textual content of SMS messages.
It applies NLP preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization before making predictions using a trained machine-learning model.
The application is designed to be lightweight, offline-capable, and easy to deploy.
